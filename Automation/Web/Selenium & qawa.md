## qawa

`qawa` stands for `QA Web Automation.`

- It is our **template project** that will help you quickly start writing maintainable UI tests for your web projects.
- See the [qawa README](https://github.com/infinum/qawa/blob/master/README.md) for details. It uses Selenium and Python in combination with the `pytest` framework.

## Page object model

`qawa` uses POM (page object model), also called the page object pattern.

Read up on it [here](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html).

## Installing Selenium and webdrivers

1. Install Homebrew (and Python 3 if it is not installed)
2. Install Selenium: `pip3 install selenium`
3. Install ChromeDriver (for Chrome): `brew install chromedriver`
4. Install geckodriver (for Firefox): `brew install geckodriver`


## Example of a page class

	from base_page import BasePage
    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By


    class BlogPage(BasePage):

    slug = "/blog"
    blog_name_label_locator = (By.CLASS_NAME, "blog-intro__heading")

    def navigate_to_page(self):
        self.navigate(self.slug)

    @property
    def blog_name_label(self):
        return self.get_present_element(self.blog_name_label_locator)

    def wait_for_blog_page_to_load(self):
        self.wait_until_element_visible(self.blog_name_label_locator)
        
- Each page class inherits from BasePage.
- Each page class can contain a slug, locators, properties, and helper methods.

## Example of a test class

	import pytest
    from logging import info
    from pages.blog_page import BlogPage
    from pages.home_page import HomePage
    import pytest_check as check


    class TestBlog:

    @pytest.fixture(scope="function")
    def set_up(self, driver, environment):
        self.blog_page = BlogPage(driver, environment)
        self.home_page = HomePage(driver, environment)

        self.home_page.navigate_to_page()

    def test_navigate_to_blog_page(self, set_up, extra):
        info("Navigates to blog posts and verifies that the blog title is correct.")

        self.home_page.blog_navigation_button.click()
        self.blog_page.wait_for_blog_page_to_load()
        self.blog_page.save_screenshot(extra)

        check.is_true(self.blog_page.blog_name_label.text == "Typing as we speak")
        
- Each test class initializes the Pages it will use by using the `set_up` fixture.
- Each test class has to begin with `Test` (example: TestBlog).
- Each test `.py` file needs to be prefixed with `test_` (`test_*.py`).
- Each test method has to begin with `test_`.
- Each test method should contain at least one assertion.

## Writing assertions

You can use either Python's standard `assert` (hard assert) or soft asserts using the [pytest_check](https://pypi.org/project/pytest_check/) plugin. You can read more about hard and soft asserts in [this handbook article](https://infinum.com/handbook/qa/automation/general/way-of-working#asserts).

### Python's standard assert examples

Checking that something exists:

	assert self.page.button.text

Checking that something is equal:

	assert self.page.button.text == "Logout"

### Soft assert examples

Here are some examples of assertion methods from the [pytest_check](https://pypi.org/project/pytest_check/) plugin. The plugin has to be imported into the test modules in order to be used. 

Checking that something exists:

	pytest_check.is_true(self.page.button)

Checking that something does not exist:

	pytest_check.is_false(self.page.button)
	
Checking that something is equal:

	pytest_check.equal(self.page.button.text, "Logout")
	
Checking that something is not equal:

	pytest_check.not_equal(self.page.button.text, "Logout")
