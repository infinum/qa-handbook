## qama

`qama` stands for `QA Mobile Automation.`
It also happens to be a [sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qama). :)

`qama` is a _template project_ with which you can quickly start writing maintainable UI tests for your mobile projects. It is based on the [pytest framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/index.html) and [Appium](https://appium.io/). For more details see the [qama README](https://github.com/infinum/qama/blob/master/README.md).

It is very similar to `qawa` which was described [in this handbook article](https://infinum.com/handbook/qa/automation/web/selenium-and-qawa).

### Setup

Before you start using `qama`, there are a few things you need to set up.
Check the [Appium setup](https://infinum.com/handbook/qa/automation/mobile/appium-setup) article for further instructions.


## Project structure

`qama` is structured using _page object model_.

In short, that means that:

- locators are placed in the appropriate page class. 
- tests are placed in the appropriate test class.

To learn more, read [this page object model](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) article.


## Page class example

- Every page class has to inherit properties and methods from the `BasePage` class.
- Every locator has to be a dictionary to support multiple platforms (currently Android and iOS).
- Every property has to be decorated with the `@property` decorator.


```
import conftest

from appium.webdriver.common.mobileby import MobileBy

from base_page import BasePage


class HomePage(BasePage):

    def __init__(self, driver, environment, package_name, platform):
        super().__init__(driver, environment, package_name, platform)

        self.__project_name_input_locator = {
            conftest.ANDROID: (MobileBy.ACCESSIBILITY_ID, "project_name_edit_text"),
            conftest.IOS: (MobileBy.ACCESSIBILITY_ID, "enter_project_name_textfield")
        }

        self.__create_project_button_locator = {
            conftest.ANDROID: (MobileBy.ID, f"{self.package_name}:id/createProjectButton"),
            conftest.IOS: (MobileBy.ACCESSIBILITY_ID, "create_project_button")
        }

    @property
    def project_name_input(self):
        return self.get_present_element(self.__project_name_input_locator[self.platform])

    @property
    def create_project_button(self):
        return self.get_present_element(self.__create_project_button_locator[self.platform])
```

## Test class example

- Pages used in tests are initialized in the `initialize_pages` fixture which is called before each test. 
- Every test file has to be prefixed with `test_` (as in `test_welcome.py`).
- Every test class has to be prefixed with `Test` (as in `TestHome`).
- Every test method has to be prefixed with `test_` (as in `test_onboarding`).


```
from logging import info

import pytest

from pages.home_page.home_page import HomePage


class TestHome:

    @pytest.fixture(scope="function", autouse=True)
    def initialize_pages(self, driver, environment, package_name, platform):
        self.home_page = HomePage(driver, environment, package_name, platform)

    @pytest.mark.smoke
    def test_onboarding(self, extra):

        self.home_page.select_language_english()
        self.home_page.next_button.click()

        self.home_page.terms_of_use_checkbox.click()
        self.home_page.privacy_notice_agree_button.click()

        assert self.home_page.create_project_button.is_enabled(), f"Button should be enabled."
        self.home_page.save_screenshot(extra)
```

### Asserts

The idea of a test is to verify some result. Therefore, each test must contain at least one assert.
