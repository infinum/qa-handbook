## What is XPath?

XPath stands for XML Path Language. It provides different types of expressions, or queries, that are used to navigate through XML and HTML documents and select a node or a set of nodes.

XPath is written in a path-like syntax that resembles the path in a traditional file system (hierarchical or tree-like structure):

`xpath_syntax = //tagname[@attribute='Value']`

`xpath_example = //input[@id='new-todo']`

When you can’t make use of other locators such as ID, Class, and so on, XPath will come in handy to locate the element because it will always be available.

Sometimes it might be rather long and not very pretty. However, you should avoid using this type of XPath, called absolute XPath, since it is quite brittle.

`/html/body/div[2]/div[1]/h4[1]/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/h4[1]`


## Briefly about nodes

When reading about XPath and XML you will often come across the term *node*.

An XML document is treated as a tree of nodes in which the nodes are in a hierarchical relationship to each other. Each node is an XML element enclosed within an opening `<` and a closing `>` tag, such as:

`<element></element>`
 
### Types of nodes

There are seven types of nodes:

- Root
- Element
- Text
- Attribute
- Comment
- Processing instruction
- Namespace
 
XML file example:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 
<library>
  <book>
    <title lang="en">The Lord of the Rings</title>
    <author>J. R. R. Tolkien</author>
    <year>1954</year>
  </book>
</library>
```

In the example above:

`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` is a processing instruction used to instruct the application how to read the document

`<library>` is the root (the topmost) element node

`<author>` is an element node

`lang="en"` is an attribute node


### Relationships between the nodes

As mentioned, the nodes are in a hierarchical relationship to each other. The terms used to describe that relationship are **parent**, **child** and **sibling**. Except for the root, every node in the hierarchy has exactly one *parent* node. A node can have any number of *child* nodes. The nodes that have the same parent are called *siblings*.

The terms that could also be used are **ancestor** and **descendant**. The parent of a node or a parent of a parent is called an *ancestor*. Similarly, a child of a node, or a child of a child node is a *descendant*.

Using the XML example above:

`<book>` is the *parent* of `<title>`, `<author>` and `<year>`

`<title>`, `<author>` and `<year>` are *siblings*

`<title>` is the *first child* of `<book>`

`<year>` is the *last child* of `<book>`


The *ancestors* of `<author>` are `<book>` and `<library>`

The *descendants* of `<library>` are `<book>`, `<title>`, `<author>` and `<year>`



## Types of XPath

There are two types of XPath:

 - Absolute XPath
 - Relative Xpath

### Absolute XPath

 - Starts with a single slash (/) which means it starts from the root element
 - It directly locates an element
 - It is fragile

Example: `/html/body/div[2]/div[1]/h4[1]/b/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/h4[1]`

### Relative XPath

 - Starts with a double slash (//) which means it starts from anywhere in the document
 - Shorter and easier to read compared to the absolute path
 - It is less fragile compared to the absolute path

Example: `//img[@id="profile_image"]`


## XPath Axes

An axis (*plural* axes) represents a relationship between the nodes, i.e. axes are used to locate a node relative to the current (context) node on the tree. 

There are 13 different axes in the XPath:

- **ancestor** - represents all ancestors of the current node
- **ancestor-or-self** - represents the current node and all its ancestors
- **attribute** - represents the attributes of the current node. It can be abbreviated with the @ sign
- **child** - represents the children of the current node
- **descendant** - represents all children (and all their children) of the current node, and all of their children
- **descendant-or-self** - represents the current node and all its descendants
- **following** - represents all the nodes that appear after the current node, except any descendant, attribute, and namespace nodes
- **following-sibling** - represents all the nodes that have the same parent as the current node and appear after the current node in the source document
- **namespace** - represents all namespace nodes of the current node. If the current node is not an element node, the result will be empty
- **parent** - represents the single node that is the parent of the current node. It can be abbreviated as two periods (..)
- **preceding** - represents all the nodes that precede the current node in the document except any ancestor, attribute, and namespace nodes
- **preceding-sibling** - represents all the nodes that have the same parent as the current node and appear before the current node in the source document
- **self** - represents the current node itself. It can be abbreviated as a single period (.)

**Examples**

Select all book nodes that are children of the current node: 

`//child::book`

Select the lang attribute of the current node:

`//attribute::lang`

Select all children nodes of the current node:

`//child::*`

Select all text node children of the current node:

`//child::text()`

Select the first child node from the list within class todo-list:

`//*[@class='todo-list']//child::li[1]`

## XPath functions

Sometimes writing a simple XPath won’t be enough. XPath includes a bunch of built-in functions for strings, numbers, booleans, node manipulation, and so on. 
You can use those functions to write more specific XPaths.

Some of the more useful ones are:

- **Contains**
- **Starts with**
- **Text**

**Contains**

`contains` is very useful when you’re trying to get the constant part of a dynamic element.

Select the todomvc.com link in the DOM:

`//*[contains(@href,'todomvc.com')]`

Select the text containing “here” in the DOM:

`//*[contains(text(),'here')]`


**Starts with**

`starts-with` checks the starting text of an attribute.

Select the image element whose `alt` text starts with "_Profile_":

`//img[starts-with(@alt,'Profile')]`

**Text**

`text` locates the element based on its text.

Select the element with the text "_About_":

`//span[text()='About']`


## How to use Chrome DevTools to find XPath

Writing XPath is sometimes tricky. It is useful to know your way around DevTools to help you with finding the right XPath. 
[TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/) app was used as an example.

1. Press **Fn + F12** to open _DevTools_

2. Open _Elements_ tab

3. While the Elements tab is active, press **Cmd + F** to open the search field

4. Type in an XPath selector 
 - If there is a match, the element(s) will be highlighted in the DOM

Examples from the images below

Select the _All_ button:

`//a[@class="selected"]`

Select the _second_ todo element:

`//*[@class="todo-list"]//child::li[2]`
