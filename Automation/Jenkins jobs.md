Jenkins is an open source automation server. It provides a multitude of plugins to support building, deploying and automating a project.
Therefore, it is quite customizable and could differ from project to project.
A job configuration will also depend on your project - how the project is set up, which plugins you want/have to use, which framework you are using, and so on.

Maybe the team is already using Jenkins, and it is configured to match the current way of work. In that case, you could probably reuse the current configuration, with minor tweaks.

This is just a short primer on creating a new job with a few examples.

There are multiple ways to set up a Jenkins job.
For more information on Jenkins, check the [official documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/getting-started/).

## Prerequisites

Jenkins should be installed and set up (plugins installed, connected to a VCS, etc.) on your machine.

You need an admin account to manage Jenkins' system configuration.


## Creating a job

1. Log into Jenkins

2. Open _Dashboard_

3. Select _New Item_ in the left-hand side menu

4. Enter the job name
 - **NOTE**: Avoid using spaces since it may cause issues
 - You might want to include the name of the VCS branch being used in the name of the job to easily distinguish it from other jobs

5. Select _Freestyle project_
 - If you already have a job created, and you want to reuse its configuration, you can create a new item from an existing one
 - In the _Copy from_ field, type in the name of the branch from which you want to copy the configuration

6. Click _OK_
 - The configuration page will open

7. Enter the job's description
 - The description will be shown under the job name on the job details page
 - It is useful when you want to quickly see information about the job without going into its configuration

8. In the _Source Code Management_ section, select the VCS you want to use (e.g. Git)

9. In _Repository URL_, enter the link to your GitHub repository 

10. In _Branches to build_, enter the branch you want to use when running the job (e.g. _*/main_)

11. In the _Build Triggers_ section, select the trigger option you want to use

12. In the _Schedule_, enter the cron syntax to specify when to run the job
 - For example: `H 22 * * 1,3,5`
 - This will run the job on Monday, Wednesday and Friday starting at 22 PM 

13. In the _Build Environment_ section, select _Abort the build if it's stuck_
 - This is an important option since if the build gets stuck it might go on for days if not handled properly

14. In the _Time-out strategy_ section, select _Absolute_
 - In the _Timeout minutes_, enter after how many minutes you want to abort the job
 - NOTE: This is just one of the approaches, and not the best one since the timeout is hardcoded. If the build normally takes longer than the specified timeout, the Jenkins will abort it

15. In the _Build_ section, click the _Add build step_ button and select _Execute a shell_

16. In the _Command_ field, enter the commands to run when the job starts
 - For example, you can specify a script and the commands to run when the job starts

    ```
    ./scripts/start_appium_server.sh
    python3 -m pytest
    ```

17. In the _Post-build Actions_ section, select an action you want to do after the job is done
 - You might want to archive artifacts such as logs, zip or jar files
 - You can also send an email notification with the job results

18. Apply and save the changes


## Multibranch pipeline

In a Multibranch Pipeline project, Jenkins automatically discovers, manages and executes Pipelines for branches that contain a `Jenkinsfile` in source control.
This way, you can have different `Jenkinsfile` for each branch of the same project.

Prerequisites:

- `Jenkinsfile` should be added to the root of your project

1. Open Jenkins

2. Select _New Item_ in the left-hand side menu

3. Enter a name for your pipeline/job
 - **NOTE**: Avoid using spaces since it may cause issues

4. Select _Multibranch Pipeline_ 

5. Click _OK_
 - A configuration page will open

6. Enter the job's description
 - The description will be shown under the job name on the job details page

7. In the _Branch Sources_ section, select the VCS you want to use (e.g. Git)

8. In _Project Repository_, enter the link to your GitHub repository 

9. Save the project
 - Jenkins automatically scans the specified repository and creates items for each branch in the repository that contains a `Jenkinsfile`
 - In case the scan does not start automatically, click the _Scan Organization Folder Now_ / _Scan Multibranch Pipeline Now_ in the left-hand side menu

For more information on Jenkins Pipeline, check the [official documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/).


## How to start a job manually

1. Open Jenkins

2. Click the job name to open its details page

3. Click _Build now_ in the left-hand side menu

![jenkins_build_now.png](/img/jenkins_build_now.png)

### Check console log

Once the job is started, you will have access to the logs for that job. Open the console log to check the logs after the job is done. 
You can even check the log while the job is running since it's updated in real time.

1. Open Jenkins

2. Click the job name to open its details page

3. Open a build's details by clicking the _build number_ in the _Build History_ section
<span style="display:block; margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:100%;">![jenkins_build_history.png](/img/jenkins_build_history.png)</span>
4. Click _Console Output_ in the left-hand side menu
