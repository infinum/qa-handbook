## 1. What is WordPress?

WordPress is an open-source Content Management System (CMS), often used as a blog publishing application, supported by PHP and MySQL. WordPress has many features, including a plugin architecture and a template system.

#### www.wordpress.org

On this website, you can download and install a script called WordPress. For this, you need a web host that supports minimal requirements and little time. WordPress is fully customizable and can be used for almost anything.

## 2. How to use WordPress?

There are several different roles a user can play. If you get an Administrator approach, you'll have absolute control of everything, the whole CMS system: adjusting settings, adding and changing content, installing plugins, themes, and many more. Of course, that also carries a lot of responsibility. You can seriously screw up something as the Administrator, and it can cost you dearly, so be careful. 

![wp_login.png](/img/wp_login.png)

To access the WP admin page, you have to use: *{domain}/wp‐login.php* (e.g., *https&#65279;://infinum.com/wp-admin/post.php*). The data entry page will appear, and you need to enter a username and password. 
After entering the correct data and clicking a Login button, you can access the WordPress system for content management/dashboard.

## 3. WordPress dashboard

The Dashboard is the centerpiece of WordPress. You can add new and edit existing content, upgrade your site with plugins, tools, create new users, and more. Depending on what you want to add to your website, you will choose a specific menu item. 

You can also use one dashboard for multiple WP projects by using multisite. 

![wp_multisite.png](/img/wp_multisite.png)

* **POSTS** - used to create, publish and edit articles (posts), categories and tags. Each new post is automatically published on the front page as well. By setting categories on articles, you can select all articles of a certain category (on the page itself).

* **MEDIA** - used to manage media files (images, documents, music files…) that you can add to articles or pages. The media library contains a display of all media files that you use in your system.

* **PAGES** - Pages are the "static" parts. They are most commonly used for content that is rarely changed, such as the contact page, the "about us" page, etc.

* **COMMENTS** - used to manage comments if you have enabled leaving comments. If you have set that you must approve the comment, you will do the same through this interface.

* **APPEARANCE** - used to control the layout of the page itself (the theme you are using). You can change themes, add widgets, edit menus, edit the header and background through this part. If you know the rules of writing HTML, CSS, and PHP, you can edit your page by writing the code.

* **PLUGINS** - Plugins allow you to increase the functionality of WordPress itself. Through this menu, you can manage existing add-ons, add new ones, or if you know how to program
using editors (editors) to change certain properties yourself. There is indeed a multitude of plugins that you can download from the Internet; Moreover, you can download them through the WordPress system itself. After installation, they need to be activated, and most of them need to be further edited (adjusted). If you do something you don't like, you can deactivate it but also delete it completely.

### USERS

Users bring a list of registered users and allow you to add new or edit existing ones. You can also set roles for users through this system. User roles are:

* **Administrator** - this role can do whatever they want with the system. That is why the Administrator should be only one person who is responsible for the site itself.
* **Editor** - a role that can write and publish their articles, but can also open and edit existing articles for editing purposes; This person can, for example, correct errors in texts or refine them, etc., and is a perfect role to set to QA. 
* **Author** - a role with these rights can write articles and publish them. Because the person alone can publish an article without your permission, it is good that you truly trust that person. 
* **Contributor** - a role that can write articles but cannot publish them. 
* **Subscriber** - a role with no right to change the content on the page itself.

### TOOLS

It brings tools that are useful for working inside and outside the system.

### SETTINGS

Settings allow you to change your system settings. Things that can be set in settings are divided into General, Writing, Reading, Discussion, Media, Privacy, and Permalinks.

## 4. Gutenberg

Since the release of the 5.0 version, WordPress has a new default content editor. Named the WordPress Gutenberg editor during development, "Gutenberg" is now called the "WordPress editor" or "block editor". Gutenberg is the name of the project for the WordPress block editor, which replaced the TinyMCE editor. 
Gutenberg's main role is to manage the WP blocks. What does that mean? In essence, Gutenberg replaced one field for editing that the TinyMCE editor had with many individual blocks. These blocks allow you to create more complex designs than those in the old classic Editor. 

![gutenberg.png](/img/gutenberg.png)

What is a block? A block can be almost anything. For example, you can have blocks for text, images, video, buttons, widgets, tables, etc. And most importantly, developers will be able to create their blocks that you can access via plugins. Now you can create WP content just like you use LEGO cubes.

### Adding blocks

![adding_icon.png](/img/adding_icon.png)

You can add a block by clicking on the icon in the top left corner. You can search for the block you want to add and choose it. 
When you select a block, you will get the block editor on the right side of the screen to adjust various setups regarding that block. 


![block.png](/img/block.png)


##  5. Add and edit new content

 WordPress has two main types of content:

 - static page(s)
 - article (post)

WordPress posts have a publication date and are displayed by date on the site's blog page.
On the other hand, pages are constant content on your site. These can be pages like "About us" or "Contact".
Pages are not affected by the time they are posted.

The article or page itself can, of course, have images and videos in various formats; Once written article or page can be re-edited, refined, and saved for future publication or, of course, deleted. If it is your role other than the Administrator will have rights as described earlier. 

### Adding new content

To add a new post, select Posts from the menu, then Add new. In front of you, a window as in the picture will open. To save, press the publish button. To add a new page from the menu, select Pages and Add new. 

![adding_new_content.png](/img/adding_new_content.png)

### Editing content
To change the content of previously written articles, select Posts, and hoover on the article you want to refine or modify. The Edit option allows you to open the entire article, as when you wrote it. For fast changes, use Quick Edit. Trash deletes your article, while with the View option, you can view the article.

## 6. Useful WordPress plugins

The most common WordPress plugins, which are also used on Infinum web, are:

* **Contact Form 7** - Contact Form 7 is used to manage multiple contact forms and allows customization to the form and the mail contents flexibility with simple markup. 

* **Advanced Custom Fields PRO** - Advanced Custom Fields PRO is used to add fields in admin dashboard settings. 

* **WP Rocket** - WP Rocket is a cache plugin used for caching the WordPress page.

* **Dashboard monitor** - This is Infinum's plugin used for checking errors within the code.

* **Yoast SEO** - Yoast SEO is used for search engine optimization.

* **Redirection** - Redirection plugin is used as a redirect manager for WordPress. It manages 301 redirections and keeps track of 404 errors.

## 7. How to use WordPress for frontend testing?

When changing something in WordPress, you could assume the process is simple. You update the intended content and click update. The trickiest part comes after you click that update button. You will need to make sure that the page is still working as it was before you update it. You will have to do this often while testing WordPress. Example of the things you should check, other than the specific thing you added or updated, are: 

* Is the page working on both Android and iPhone?
* Is the contact form on the page still working in Safari?
* Is the mobile menu opening on Android?
* Did the footer disappear?

As QA, you will be testing the visual and functional thing regarding WordPress. You will need to make sure that any content added or changed is looking good on the frontend. It's recommended you always do this on staging first and later do a production re-check. For example, if you are testing buttons, you can edit that button in WordPress in various ways such as its width, height, text, or color.
Whenever you are testing anything on the frontend, you should make sure no content on any screen is overlaying with each other. Sometimes you will have to test forms on WordPress. You can test a form by checking its visual display on the page in various viewports, and you should also check if that form is working. You can test it by checking which plug is in use for forms, and there you can check if the form was successfully sent, e.g., Hubspot.

## 8. WordPress test cases
### WordPress - common bugs

The most common bugs you will probably encounter while testing WordPress are:

* Issues with uploading images in admin - sometimes you will notice that the page's images are missing, or you cannot upload new ones. When you try to upload an image, you get an error. Firstly, check your role and capabilities. If you have a role that can edit images, then Congrats!,  you found a bug. 

* Images displaying on frontend - very often, you will encounter a problem with images not being displayed properly on the frontend or not displaying at all. You might encounter a lazy loading problem with images as well.  If you notice images are taking a lot of time to load, the issue might also be:

    * Larger picture
    * Slow internet speed
    * Server performance issues
    
* User role capabilities - sometimes, you will encounter an issue regarding the capability the user role should have, but it's missing. For example, the admin role does not have all capabilities (e.g. the role has problems with post-editing). The best solution is to have a list of capabilities for every role and test each of them. You will need WP dev, who's probably the admin role, to change your roles while testing. 

* Content display on different screens - even when our developers use a wrapper that gives them the options to set how the block behaves on your cell phone, tablet, and large displays, it is common that the block doesn't behave as expected, so it's very important to check both small screens and very large screens.

* When WordPress gets an update, it's common that some things break during that process. The best way to test an update is to do a smoke test of the entire wp-admin and frontend. Ensure user roles still have the capabilities they should have and that nothing is looking funny on the front. Also, check the forms on your page because some common issues are related to form behavior. Depending on the update, different issues can occur. For example, on our Infinum web, when we updated to 5.5. WP, we lost all of our images because lazy loading was added. On this page (https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/), you can find the version you update from and the version you update to and fly through the new changes on each version in between.

* Although WP plugins can be useful, they are often avoided because the integration can be quite challenging and can slow down the web. Plugins you can find on almost any Infinum wp projects are  Yoast, WP rocket, and Advanced custom fields Pro. There can be a situation where plugins aren't compatible, but this depends on a case-by-case scenario. You can find the list of [incompatible plugins](https://wordpress.com/support/incompatible-plugins/) here. 

## 9. What do you need to know before WordPress testing?

* You need to test both WP admin and frontend.
* Pages are created not by design but by blocks and components.
* Every block is adjustable.
* Some values are hardcoded.
* Test every block independently.
* Create a new page for QA only.
