Welcome to the QA team glossary! 

The glossary is meant to help you get familiar with words and phrases commonly used in everyday work. If you ever get confused or lost with the word used on your project weekly, the first thing you can do is check out our glossary!



### A

- **Accessibility** - is the practice of making websites or apps usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using smaller mobile devices, or those with slow network connections
- **Agile** - refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. Agile is a time-boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end. It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two-week cycles. 
- **Alert** - alerts convey important information related to the state of your app or the device, and often request feedback. An alert consists of a title, an optional message, one or more buttons, and optional text fields for gathering input. 
- **Alfred** - is an app for macOS which boosts your efficiency with hotkeys, keywords, text expansion, and more (An advanced "Spotlight" for quickly executing certain actions).
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** - a versatile command-line tool used for communicating with your Android device via the terminal.
- **Android File Transfer** - used for transferring files between an Android phone and a macOS system.

### R

- **Refactoring** - in computer programming and software design, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its non-functional attributes), while preserving its functionality. Usually, older projects need code refactoring.
- **Regression Testing** - is much more thorough than smoke testing. Regression testing involves checking every possible aspect of the pre-existing app features after a new feature or bug fix is deployed. This is to make sure that the code updates didn't break any other area of the software. Or in other words - a full test of the app.
- **Release** - A release is the distribution of the final version of an application. A software release may be either public or private and generally constitutes the initial generation of a new or upgraded application. 
- **Release candidate** - is a version that is ready to be released to the public, assuming no major bugs are found during testing.

Agile is a set of principles and scrum is a framework for getting things done.
- **Scrum master** - ensures the team lives agile values and principles and follows the processes and practices that the team agreed they would use.
- **SDK (Software development kit)** - a collection of software development tools in one installable package. They ease the creation of applications by having a compiler, debugger, and perhaps a software framework.

- **Sprint backlog** - the collection of tasks defined on the sprint planning meeting, along with their associated product backlog items, forms a second backlog called the sprint backlog.
- **Sprint planning** - performed by the product owner, development team, and Scrum master. The goal is to: determine the most important items of the product backlog to build in the next sprint, break down each targeted feature into a set of tasks, set a sprint goal - what the upcoming sprint is supposed to achieve.
- **Sprint retrospective** - a team meeting held after the sprint review. It is an "improvement" meeting attended by all – the product owner, Scrum master, development team members, QA, and only optionally with the stakeholders.
- **Sprint review** - a meeting held (mostly) on the last day of the sprint in which the team presents the results of the sprint to the stakeholders.
- **Staging** - web environment for testing and content before the official production release.
- **Stakeholders** - stakeholders are the purpose for which a product or service is created in the first place. They have certain requirements that need to be fulfilled. It is the responsibility of the Scrum team to fulfill the given requirements of the stakeholders and satisfy them.
- **Stetho (Android)** - is used for examining network traffic, layout, etc. in Android apps via Chrome.
- **Story point** - a metric used in agile project management and development to estimate the difficulty of implementing a given user story.
- **Staged rollout (Android**) - a method of updating an application while reaching only a certain percentage of users (in stages). It enables us to release a single product version very slowly - over a certain period of time (counterpart of "Phased rollout").

- **Use case** - a use case is a written description of how users will perform tasks on your website or app. It outlines, from a user's point of view, a system's behavior as it responds to a request. Each use case is represented as a sequence of simple steps, beginning with a user's goal and ending when that goal is fulfilled.
- **User stories** - an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer.
- **UI (User interface)** - the series of screens, pages, and visual elements (like buttons and icons) that enable a user to interact with a product or service.
