UX design refers to user experience design, while UI design stands for user interface design. Both of these are crucial to an IT product and need to work closely together.

Despite being very integral to each other, the roles themselves are quite different, involving distinct processes.

## What is UI design?

The user interface is the graphical layout of an application.

It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields, and all the rest of the items the user interacts with. 

This includes screen layout, transitions, interface animations and every single micro-interaction. Any sort of visual element, interaction, or animation must all be designed.

UI designers create the look and feel of an application’s user interface.

## What is UX design?

A user’s experience of the app is determined by how they interact with it. 

Is the experience smooth and intuitive or clunky and confusing? Does navigating the app feel logical or does it feel arbitrary? 

Does interacting with the app give people the sense that they’re efficiently accomplishing the tasks they set out to achieve or does it feel like a struggle? 

User experience is determined by how easy or difficult it is to interact with the user interface elements that the UI designers have created.

### UI elements

Every day we work on tasks, write bug reports, check apps design, write test cases, etc. It's important to use a correct naming for different elements in the app so everyone on the project is on the same page. Of course, some elements have various names.

In the next few sections, UI elements are shown. They are divided in three pages: web apps, iOS apps and Android apps.
