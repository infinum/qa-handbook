## Basic info
Here we will mention basic stuff about Chrome Dev tools, why it is important for QA and what features we use.

**What the heck is it?**

Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. It is available in any version of Chrome browser.

Every browser has developer tools, and they look similar for almost all browsers. Chrome web browser is the most common in usage that's why we write about it.

**Why do we use it?**

We use it for easier testing, to improve our bug reports and help developers with bug fixing.

Etc. use Chrome Dev tools in these situations:

* when there is a backend bug and you can not see it on UI
* when you want to clear cache, cookies or server data
* when you want to check if the page is implemented by design
* when you want to see if the frontend app is sending requests to backend

## Practical stuff

### How to use

You can open dev tools with *F12 button* or *right click - inspector*
After that you will be placed in Elements tab.

### Elements panel

In elements panel you can see page structure in *HTML* and *CSS*.

**What are HTML and CSS?**

A Web page is made up from HTML and CSS code. HTML defines the structure of the web page and CSS defines visual representation of HTML elements. Every browser can render HTML and CSS code.
Here is more info about HTML and CSS:

* [HTML intro](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
* [CSS intro](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)

### Inspect element

Two most common ways of inspecting elements are:

* via Inspect element icon
* hovering with mouse over the HTML code

*Inspect element icon* is placed in upper left corner of dev tools.

### Device toolbar

Chrome dev tools provide the check on the multiple mobile resolutions via device toolbar. Device toolbar icon is placed next to inspect element icon in upper left corner of dev tools.
You can use responsive design by clicking on *Toggle device toolbar* icon.

While it is preferable to check the issue on the actual device, there are some cases in which Device toolbar is acceptable to use:

* when there is no device available
* when you are in a hurry, need to test something fast
* when something is a quick fix and is not related to mobile layout

**Note that some bugs will appear only on an actual device while with dev tools they won't**

### Styles tab

It is placed bellow the page. We use it to check the CSS property of selected element.

Here we can add modify or remove CSS property of selected element and change the page UI. Changes you made will not be applied to actual page, you can refresh the page and return to old look

We use Elements panel when:

* we want to check that the page is implemented by design (Check CSS property of the page).
* we want to make improvement, move element left or right increase padding, change text or similar.
* in automation when we want to locate the element.

### Console

There may be times that you donâ€™t see any of your experiment changes on the UI part of the site. In console panel you will see errors marked in red. Errors are usually fatal when the page is not working as expected.

*Note: there will be console error on every page but you need to report only fatal error*

Use the console in following cases:

* When you click on some element and nothing happens
* When you are constantly getting error from the server
* When page elements are not loaded

### Network panel

The Network panel records information about each network operation on your site, including detailed timing data, HTTP request and response headers, cookies, WebSocket data, and more.

In other words, in the network panel you can see all the data that is coming from the server. This data is needed for the page to load.

When to use network tab:

* when we want to see the received content from the server
* when we want to see status of some request
* when we want to see how much time does it take for request

***Check the request status from network panel:***

In case when you have to check response that you get from the server you should do the folowing:

1. Click on network panel in inspector
2. Reload the page
3. You will see network requests
4. Click on one of network requests

You can check request status and all kinds of request information in headers.
You can also see the request content and preview it in one of the following options.

### How to clear cache, cookies, session and local storage

Pages are cached in every browser. The main reason for that is that the operating system keeps a page cache in order to save the memory(RAM) and improve device and page performance.

**Note: Emptying cache is very important during testing process cause new changes pushed to staging won't be visible on page that you are testing.**

There are few ways on how to clear the cache:

* the easiest way is *right click on refresh icon in browser* choose *Empty cache and hard reload*
* second easy way is to open a private tab in browser

***Clear local storage:***

1. right click and run inspector
2. choose applications panel
3. expand local storage folder
4. right click on content in this folders
5. click clear and storage will be deleted

***Clear session storage:***

1. right click and run inspector
2. choose applications panel
3. expand session storage folder
4. right click on content in this folders
5. click clear and storage will be deleted
