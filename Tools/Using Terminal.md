## About Terminal

Terminal, also known as _command-line interface_ (CLI) or _console_, allows you to run commands on a computer without using a graphical user interface. CLI accepts text-based inputs which then converts into functions that the operating system understands. You can use various commands, from simple ones for switching directories to more complex such as running scripts with multiple flags.

## How to open Terminal

Use Spotlight search on your Mac to find it.

1. Press _Cmd + Space_ on your keyboard to open Spotlight
2. Type in _Terminal_ and hit Enter

Now add it to the Dock to reach it more easily :)

1. Right-click on the Terminal icon in the Dock
2. Select _Options_
3. Select _Keep in Dock_


## Terminal settings

### Terminal appearance

You might want to update the appearance of your Terminal to make it a bit more readable. There are quite a few options to change the color of the background, size and color of the text, cursor, and so on.

1. Open Terminal
2. Click Terminal in the toolbar
3. Select Preferences
4. Select the Profiles tab
5. Select the Text tab

## Change Terminal behavior

There are also various options to edit the Terminal behaviour, spread across multiple tabs: Window, Tab, Shell, Keyboard, Advanced.

For example, under the _Shell_ tab you can specify the command that is run on startup:

1. Select the Shell tab under Profiles
2. Select the _Run command_ checkbox
3. In the input field, type in the command you wish to run, for example:
  - `cd /Users` to open the Terminal positioned to the Users directory
  - `echo $$` to run the `echo` command right after the Terminal opens


Another interesting option is to close the Terminal window when the shell exits. This can be useful when you run shell commands from your project and don't want to leave the Terminal open.

1. Select the Shell tab under Profiles
2. From the dropdown in _When the shell exits_ select _Close the window_ option
   - if you run the `exit` command, the Terminal window will close


## Terminal alternatives

The Terminal is not the only app for using the command line on the Mac. There are various alternatives such as [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), [Hyper](https://hyper.is/), [Upterm](https://upterm.dev/) and [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), to name a few.
Each of these comes with some differences when compared to the Terminal, often adding additional features.

## Shell

A shell is a computer program that basically allows you to control your computer. You can use it to control other programs, interact with the system, or simply automate repetitive tasks. The commands can be entered directly, or read from a file called the shell script.

To access a shell you need an app that runs it, such as Terminal/iTerm2 on Mac or Command Prompt/GitBash on Windows.

There are various shell programs to choose from, like _sh_, _bash_, _ksh_, _tcsh_ and _zsh_.

- **sh** or Bourne Shell
  - the original shell still used on UNIX systems
  - very basic with a few features

- **bash** or Bourne Again Shell
  - the [GNU Project's](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html) shell
  - it's compatible with _sh_, meaning commands that work in _sh_ also work in _bash_ (vice-versa is not always the case)
  - provides additional features and improvements over _sh_

- **zsh** or Z-shell
  - extended version of _sh_, including some _bash_ features
  - quite similar to _bash_ but with some improvements and more customizable
  - commands that work in _bash_ work in _zsh_


## Command-line arguments

When reading about command-line arguments, you might come across terms like _flag_, _switch_, _option_, _argument_, _parameter_, and so on, which are often used interchangeably.

Arguments tell the process or function to perform a different operation depending on its value. Arguments are often used in command-line programs, and they are basically options that change the behaviour of a program.

There are a couple of types of arguments:

- Arguments that take a value
- Arguments that don't take a value
- Positional arguments

Arguments can start with a single dash (-) or a double dash (--).

A **flag** argument usually refers to a boolean argument that by including it, it changes the behaviour of a program. If you include a flag argument its boolean value is set to true, if not, it is set to false.
For example,

`~ ls` - lists all visible files and folders in the current folder, but if we add the flag `-a`, making it

`~ ls -a` - it lists all visible and invisible files and folders.

In the following example command, using the `--report` flag we tell the process to include/activate the report option.
With the `--report` flag included a report is generated, and without the flag it is not.

`python test.py --report `


Arguments that start with a double dash (--) often take an argument themselves.
For example, in a Python script we might have the `env` flag that activates a different environment depending on the value we specify when including the `--env` argument:

`python test.py --env=test_environment`

`python test.py --env=staging_environment`

| **ps -ax &#124; grep Appium** | Display processes that contain Appium |
