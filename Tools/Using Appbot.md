## What's Appbot?

Appbot is a tool for collecting and monitoring user app reviews and ratings.

### How to use Appbot

1. Log in to the **Appbot** account and click on **Manage Sources** in the navigation bar.
2. Choose an app from the sources list *(Note: if you can't find the app you are looking for in the Sources list, you can add it manually)*

A page containing reviews, ratings and other statistics for the chosen app should open. There you can find many filtering and analysis options for user reviews and ratings:

### How to integrate Appbot with Slack

Among other options, Appbot can automatically send Google Play and App Store reviews to Slack (and other apps/services as well), making it easier to monitor user reviews. 

Setting up a Slack integration for an Appbot account takes only a few minutes: 

1. Log in to the **Appbot** account and click on **Manage Sources** in the navigation bar.
2. In the sources list, find the app you want to integrate with Slack and click on the "+" button under the Integrations column. *(Note: if you can't find the app you are looking for in the Sources list, you have to add it)*
3. Find **Slack** and click on the **Add Integration** button.
4. Click **Add to Slack**.
5. Sign in to your **Slack** account.
6. Choose which **channel** you would like Appbot to send the reviews to and click **Allow**.
7. Choose which reviews you would like sent to Slack (e.g. weekly summaries, individual reviews, specific star ratings, countries, etc.). 
8. Click **Save** once you’re done.

Congrats, you’ve set up your Slack integration! :)

Depending on your needs, you can easily set up filtering of the reviews you send to Slack, e.g. by star rating, country/language or topic.

The reviews sent to Slack contain quick links so that you can reply to user reviews quickly and easily.
