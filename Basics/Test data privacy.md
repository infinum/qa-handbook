## Introduction

Test data privacy means making sure that any data used for testing is kept safe and does not reveal real information about people or companies. Keeping test data anonymized is important because it protects our clients and helps us follow legal and industry rules.

## Disclaimer

As QA, we do not own any data. Our job is to remind everyone that test data should always be anonymized. We must do everything we can to protect the clientâ€™s reputation and keep their information safe.

## Project and Test Data Table

You can find the table with all currently active projects, information about test data in use, and the responsible person for each project at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xm9i5juNLcAQJR9r7YiVd7k6qSHyHb-ZN90VoG2CmR4/edit?usp=sharing).

## Process Owner

Vanja Bobotic is the owner of this initial process. He will talk to every responsible person on a project, check the status of test data, update the table, and mark the responsible person for this statement. He will also keep an eye on the list of active projects and update it if needed. After the initial phase, the Lead QA or Lead test automation engineer will take over this process.

## Procedure

When a new project starts, the responsible person should follow these steps:

1. Check if the project is listed in the active projects table.
2. Make sure all test data is anonymized before use.
3. Confirm with Vanja Bobotic about the status of test data and update the table if needed.
4. Mark the responsible person for the project in the table.
5. Review the table regularly to keep information up to date.

By following these steps, we help protect our clients and keep our processes in line with ISO certification needs.
