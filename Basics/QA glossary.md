Welcome to the QA team glossary! 

The glossary is meant to help you get familiar with words and phrases commonly used in everyday work. If you ever get confused or lost with the word used on your project weekly, the first thing you can do is check out our glossary!



### A

- **Accessibility** - is the practice of making websites or apps usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using smaller mobile devices, or those with slow network connections
- **Agile** - A particular way of working, a set of values and principles.
It is an iterative approach to project management and software development where the focus is delivering work (builds with features) in small increments.
It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short cycles.
Contrary to betting everything on a big launch (waterfall method).
- **Alert** - alerts convey important information related to the state of your app or the device, and often request feedback. An alert consists of a title, an optional message, one or more buttons, and optional text fields for gathering input. 
- **Alfred** - is an app for macOS that boosts your efficiency with hotkeys, keywords, text expansion, and more (An advanced "Spotlight" for quickly executing certain actions).
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** - a versatile command-line tool used for communicating with your Android device via the terminal.
- **Android File Transfer** - used for transferring files between an Android phone and a macOS system.
- **Android ROM** - a file containing the executable instructions (a system image) of an Android OS and affiliated apps. The "stock ROM" comes installed on the phone or tablet, while a "custom ROM" comes from a third party.
- **Android Studio** - is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system.
- **API (Application Programming Interface)** - Application Programming Interface, software that enables 2 different systems to talk to one another (using JSON in most cases), like a power plug - the standardized interface between the power grid and house appliance that hides the complex and, for the user, unnecessary stuff.
- **App environments** - an environment is the application's mechanism for bringing together components with the agent that deploys them. Environments are typically modeled on some stage of the software project lifecycle, such as development or production.
- **Appbot** - the tool we use for collecting and monitoring user app reviews.

- **Burndown chart** - is a graphic representation of how quickly the team is working through user stories. It shows the total effort against the amount of work.

### C

- **Cache** - Temporary storage space for data. When you visit a website, the files that you request are automatically stored in the cache. 
If you return to that same website in the near future, your browser will retrieve the necessary files from your cache rather than from the original server—so the webpage will load quicker.
- **Charles** - a proxy app used for examining network traffic between your device and a server by staging a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Chrome DevTools** - a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser.
- **ChroPath** - a Google Chrome extension that will help you locate web elements when doing UI automation.

- **Code snippet** - a code snippet is a small block of reusable code.
- **Cookies** - are files created by websites you visit. They make your online experience easier by saving browsing information. With cookies, sites can keep you signed in, remember your site preferences, and give you locally relevant content.
- **CopyClip** - a simple and efficient clipboard manager for your Mac.
- **Crashlytics** - a part of Firebase; used for getting crash/error logs from mobile apps.

- **EOD (End of the Day)** - usually refers to a deadline set by yourself or your project manager.
- **EOY (End of the Year)** - usually refers to a project deadline or quarterly goal deadline.
- **Exploratory testing** - means testing with existing experience and knowledge of the mobile app or website. This insight gives the QA tester the ability to have a focused engagement without following formal test cases. Or in other words, testing the whole app without any specific plan or without using test cases. 

### F

- **FakeGPS** - a tool for mocking your GPS location.

### J

- **Java vs Javascript** - Java is mostly used for developing desktop and mobile applications and JavaScript for web applications.
Java also requires developers to use classes (which are reusable templates) for everything and has a more rigid syntax where after you declare a variable as a specific type of data, you can’t later change it by assigning a different type of data.
JavaScript can be used more loosely and action like this is allowed.
It is used for frontend development but with the recent appearance of the Node.js framework, it is possible to use it for the backend also.

Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its non-functional attributes), while preserving its functionality. Usually, older projects need code refactoring.
- **Regression Testing** - is much more thorough than smoke testing. Regression testing involves checking every possible aspect of the pre-existing app features after a new feature or bug fix is deployed. This is to make sure that the code updates didn't break any other area of the software. Or in other words - a full test of the app.

- **Sprint backlog** - the collection of tasks defined on the sprint planning meeting, along with their associated product backlog items, forms a second backlog called the sprint backlog.
- **Sprint planning** - performed by the product owner, development team, and Scrum master. The goal is to: determine the most important items of the product backlog to build in the next sprint, break down each targeted feature into a set of tasks, set a sprint goal - what the upcoming sprint is supposed to achieve.
- **Sprint retrospective** - a team meeting held after the sprint review. It is an "improvement" meeting attended by all – the product owner, Scrum master, development team members, QA, and only optionally with the stakeholders.
- **Sprint review** - a meeting held (mostly) on the last day of the sprint in which the team presents the results of the sprint to the stakeholders.
- **Staging** - web environment for testing and content before the official production release.
- **Stakeholders** - stakeholders are the purpose for which a product or service is created in the first place. They have certain requirements that need to be fulfilled. It is the responsibility of the Scrum team to fulfill the given requirements of the stakeholders and satisfy them.
- **Stetho (Android)** - is used for examining network traffic, layout, etc. in Android apps via Chrome.
- **Story point** - a metric used in agile project management and development to estimate the difficulty of implementing a given user story.

- **Udemy** - open online course provider.
- **Use case** - a use case is a written description of how users will perform tasks on your website or app. It outlines, from a user's point of view, a system's behavior as it responds to a request. Each use case is represented as a sequence of simple steps, beginning with a user's goal and ending when that goal is fulfilled.
- **User stories** - an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer.
