## Test automation?

Test automation, in a nutshell, is the practice of implementing solutions that make verifying certain requirements faster and more reliable. It is often combined with CI/CD services to make the whole code-test-deploy process more streamlined.

At this point in time, test automation techniques cannot replace all facets of software testing, but they are certainly useful for regression testing of any sort.

## Test Automation Engineer?

Since creating automated tests requires certain technical skills that are not prerequisites for most aspects of testing, we decided to create a separate role which would focus on automation itself.

This does not mean that all automated tests needs to be implemented by Test Automation Engineers (TAE), but we find it beneficial that there is a group of people exclusively working on developing our automation skillset, toolset, and processes.

Test Automation Engineers are a part of the QA team.

## Responsibilities 

Main responsibilities of the TAE role are:

- Developing test automation suites on various projects
- Researching new technologies, libraries and services
- Working on new and existing libraries and tooling
- Defining new processes and improving existing processes and technologies
- Maintaining technical aspects of the QA Handbook
- Technical management of complex projects
- Mentoring and education
